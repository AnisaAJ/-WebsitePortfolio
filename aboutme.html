            My passion for learning indepth code came from growing up with computers and video games. I always wanted to be able to create
            something for myself. When I took my first Website Design class in High School, the doors opened for me. I grew relentless in learning
            HTML and CSS. After finishing the class I knew I enjoyed Website Design with all my heart. This launched me into wanting to
            major in Computer Science. As I already had a desire for computers as well at the time.
